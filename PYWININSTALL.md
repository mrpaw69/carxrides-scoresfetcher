# Installing Python and installing required packages on Windows

1. Check if Python is installed properly. Open cmd.exe by pressing Windows + R and typing cmd, then type `python` and hit Enter. If it opens Microsoft Store or says command not found, Python is either not installed or misconfigured. If it shows Python 3 idle(version, etc.), Python is installed, **skip to step 5**

2. Go to https://python.org, then click Downloads, and then Windows. Download a Python 3 installer for your processor architecture, and open it

3. If you see options like "repair", or "uninstall", check step 1 again, otherwise just skip to step 4. If typing `python` in command prompt shows "python is not recognized" or opens Microsoft Store, click "Uninstall".

4. **MAKE SURE** to check "Add Python to PATH", or else command prompt won't recognize the new installed Python. After you've done that, click "Install"

5. Go to folder where you downloaded CarXRides-ScoresFetcher and double-click `bootstrap.bat` to open it. If Smart Screen prevents it from starting, click "More info" and then "Run anyway"

Now that you've installed everything needed to run the script, move on to the next step: [Preparing to use](./README.md#preparing-to-use)
